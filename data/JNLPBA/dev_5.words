A 1.2 kb FasL promoter responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with p65 Rel or Fos/Jun .
Together , these findings suggest that LITAF plays an important role in the activation of the human TNF-alpha gene and proposes a new mechanism to control TNF-alpha gene expression .
The rhombotin family of cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes : distinct members are involved in T-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13 .
Nuclear run-on experiments showed that THP inhibited transcription of the IL-1 beta gene .
This minimal promoter exhibits B-cell-specific activity and contains SP1 , ETS , OCT , and IKAROS/LYF-1 transcription factor motifs .
In vitro translated hGR was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid .
Using purified recombinant p50 , p65 , and c-Rel proteins , optimal DNA-binding motifs were selected from a pool of random oligonucleotides .
An NF-kappa B binding site is an essential component of the element but alone is not sufficient to account for the activity or the specificity of the element .
Protein-tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of interleukin 1beta and NFkappaB activation , but not NFkappaB nuclear translocation .
Dependence for the proliferative response to erythropoietin on an established erythroid differentiation program in a human hematopoietic cell line , UT-7 .
Three E2F DNA-binding activities were identified in resting ( G0 ) T cells with mobilities in gel shift assays distinct from those of previously defined E2F complexes .
Here , we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in Jurkat T cells and in primary blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
The expression of the progesterone receptor in human peripheral blood lymphocytes was analysed , using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( Abbott PgR-EIA monoclonal ) , in order to evaluate its prognostic character in the context of spontaneous abortion .
Much higher concentrations of wild type peptides were needed to activate T cells at neutral pH .
We found that in T cells , anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF , whereas the induction of other NF-kappaB family members was not significantly affected .
Both cell lines are devoid of genetic lesions of c-MYC , BCL-2 and p53 as well as gross rearrangements of BCL-6 .
Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the -137 to -64 element in COS-7 cells .
The effects of many C-11-substituted 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 analogs on HL-60 cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism .
Antisense experiments that knocked out endogenous Sp3 expression in the myelomocytic cell line , HL60 , revealed that Sp3 participates in activation of the CD11c and CD11b promoters in vivo .
Unstimulated MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) T cells constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the FLRE .
Exogenous recombinant Tat protein was also able to upregulate c-fos promoter activity in serum-activated Jurkat and U937 cells , as well as endogenous c-fos mRNA expression and c-Fos protein synthesis in both serum-activated cell lines and primary PBMC .
Both BZLF1 and BRLF1 immediate-early transcripts , but not BMLF1 transcript , could be detected in individual CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infected with EBV .
We have studied the proliferation and CD40 antigen expression of lymphocytes , and the cytotoxicity to monocytes , of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the SP II promoter of HBV mRNA ( sequence I ) and the X gene ( sequence II ) in patients with chronic hepatitis B .
Consistent with this result , these cell lines expressed increased levels of mRNAs encoding the AP-1 proteins , c-Fos , Fra-1 , c-Jun , JunB , and JunD .
The MNDA mRNA level in the myeloid cell lines was also unaffected by the latter four agents .
